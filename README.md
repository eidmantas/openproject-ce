# OpenProject Community Repository

This is the OpenProject community archive that existed to build bundled OpenProject core and plugins for packaged installations. All new releases will be available at our main repository at https://github.com/opf/openproject .


## What is the difference between [opf/openproject-ce](https://github.com/opf/openproject-ce) and [opf/openproject](https://github.com/opf/openproject) ?

The split between historic reasons. opf/openproject was only the core without community plugins such as costs, backlogs, etc.
They were developed in separate Git repositories and then merged into opf/openproject-ce to build the full edition.

Some months back, we decided to work on everything that openproject-ce is made of from within opf/openproject and merged the plugins there. This happend in this  PR: https://github.com/opf/openproject/pull/6826

With 9.0., we're going to remove openproject-ce so it will only remain for legacy and previous installations. From 9.0. on, all packages will be released there.
